## About the Project
Welcome aboard! Neural-Networks-Ahoy is a state-of-the-art deep learning project focused on automatic ship classification using neural networks. Our goal is to revolutionize maritime surveillance, security, and logistics by providing an accurate, scalable, and efficient solution to identify and categorize different types of ships from images.

This project leverages cutting-edge neural network techniques to analyze ship characteristics, radar data, and satellite imagery, enabling precise vessel classification. It empowers maritime authorities, shipping companies, and naval forces in vessel identification, traffic management, and maritime security, enhancing operational efficiency and safety across global waters.
